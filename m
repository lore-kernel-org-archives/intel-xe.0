That's only half of the error codes.

You don't have to lecture me on the complexity of KMS.  It's actually 
not that complex; it's huge in size, but that's a different problem.

The XDC presentation made it sound as if the goal was to improve 
compositor quality of service.  With this series, it sounds more like 
it's for debugging purposes.  Those are distinct problems and I ind it 
confusing. I'd like to suggest to focus on one problem first.

The display-mode error codes are almost all related to hardware and 
display limitations. They are not related to any specific hardware 
device.  The goal for KMS error reporting should be to to build 
something similar one a wider scope.   Additional details about driver, 
GPU and display are available today. There's no need for more interfaces 
there.

No. We give every error condition an individual error code; not every 
return path. These are distinct things.

Some examples:

- For planes, the given format and sizes might be unsupported. Those 
would be error codes.

- For the CRTC, most driver's atomic checks tests the mode against the 
hardware limits. Existing display-mode constants tell us what to expect 
there.

- Encoders and connectors often mirror these properties on a lower 
level, such as bus formats, bus transfer rates, etc. They could likely 
reuse some of the error codes.

- Then there are cases where pipeline stages cannot be connected with 
each other. That's another distinct error code.

Apart from these plain atomic states, DRM exposes many settings as typed 
property. These can likely be subsumed under a number of generic error 
codes. For example

- Most properties can have an invalid-value error

- Numeric properties can have additional value-too-low and 
value-too-high errors.

If you have properties that conflict with each other; return a list of 
their ids with a conflicting-values error code.

With all this, user-space compositors have plenty of information to 
create bug reports or try to resolve the problem automatically.

> driver an individual error code. I don't think that is feasible (and
> then that error code would be uAPI).

Yes, the codes will be uAPI. There are already plenty of defines and 
constants everywhere in the kernel's uAPI. There are already >130 errno 
code in the uAPI. If we need another 100 or 200 error codes for KMS, I'd 
be fine with that.

You must be new here. Anything that goes through the uAPI channels is 
de-facto uAPI. If a program in user space might rely on it, it cannot be 
changed.

IF you want to get filenames or lines or any other volatile information, 
you can get them via debugfs. It's designated to be unstable.

With KMS, we have been able to build a hardware-neutral interface for 
programming the display pipeline. I don't believe that error codes are a 
special exception from that.
