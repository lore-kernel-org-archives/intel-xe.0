I agree, (although I think the "invalidate_attachment" needs to be
discussed). In the end the importer should be given a choice, either
pin  and accept that subsequent attachers might see errors or accept
app disruption.

Current design appears to be that attach only determines the set of
theoretically possible mapping types, disregarding other attachments.=20
Taking other attachments into account is also problematic because the
dma-resv lock is not held.

Looking at current GPU drivers, what you describe above is typically
done at pin() time, but if some importers want an early very likely
decision on what mapping_type to use, one could introduce a separate
function that match the mapping_types, but that would be very similar
to the map() function but without returning a sgt/mapping, or a pin()
without actually pinning. One could reuse the invalidate_mappings()
callback to indicate the mapping type is no longer valid?
