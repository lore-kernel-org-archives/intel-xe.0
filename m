Interesting. Does that imply that a shmem folio can be replaced
underneath without additional measures? It looks like most DRM
call sites imply that mapping_set_unevictable() pins underlying shmem
folios

Exactly.

x86 implementation is here:
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v7.1-rc3/source/arch/x86/mm/pat/set_memory=
.c#L2556

TTM calls it here:
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v7.1-rc3/source/drivers/gpu/drm/ttm/ttm_po=
ol.c#L249

And there are actually shmem helpers that do this as well, without
pooling.
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v7.1-rc3/source/drivers/gpu/drm/drm_gem_sh=
mem_helper.c#L212

The way the TTM pools work are that there are separate pools for each
allocation order and caching modes. That would essentially mean
allocations from a single shmem object would be spread out across
different pools, and we'd loose the 1:1 mapping between DRM objects and
shmem objects.

One alternative would be a single large sparse shmem object common for
all DRM objects, with a range allocator, but that also got pretty ugly
when I tried to implement that.

Finally, (and I think that might be what Christian was getting at as
well) Without CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE, we'd only see order 0 shmem
folios, right?

Thanks,
Thomas
