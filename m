Thanks for typing this up, matches what I think is going on here.

Yeah just quickly wanting to add here that in my opinion, trying to sort
this out in all the various subsystem is not how we should even start to
think about this issue. This would be a fundamental change in how
subsystems are allowed to nest locking with stuff that can trigger
userspace faults.

I did ponder a bit how this could be solved on the fuse side of things,
maybe with some seccomp style filters. Like maybe lockdep could be
enlisted to help catch deadlocks, with a special "this is a fuse process,
it all defacto runs in fault handler context. But that only catches bugs
in normal use, not malicious exploits. And given that userspace can choose
the timing and unblock at will (I think so at least), this is pretty
powerful tool for being nasty to the kernel.

But mostly I want to really, really stand back in awe about this issue and
not think too hard about it.

Cheers, Sima
