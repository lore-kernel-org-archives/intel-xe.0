panthor_vm_prepare_mapped_bos_resvs() locks every external object mapped
in the VM and then validates the evicted ones. Validation here means
panthor_vm_bo_validate(), which swaps the BO's pages back in and restores
its VMAs. That is slow, and an external object is one which can be shared
with another process, so the whole of it happens while holding dma-resv
locks other processes may be waiting on.

Nothing is gained by holding those. A resident object needs no swapping
in; only the evicted ones do. Split the locking into the two passes
gpuvm now understands: the early pass takes just the evicted external
objects and swaps them in, and the late pass takes the ones which were
resident and are therefore normally ready to use as they are. Private
objects are covered by the VM resv, which is held from the start, so
evicted ones are still validated in the early pass.

The split is only worth it when there is something to validate, so
drm_gpuvm_needs_two_pass() decides, and a submit with nothing evicted
keeps doing exactly what it does today in a single pass.

Both passes run in the same drm_exec transaction, so nothing is unlocked
in between and the late pass only ever adds locks. They take disjoint
sets of objects, so passing slot_count to both still reserves it exactly
once per object.

The early pass reads the evicted state without the object's dma-resv,
that being the lock it is trying not to take. The race is benign: an
object evicted right after the early pass skipped it is picked up by the
late pass instead, which is why that pass still validates.

Validation here allocates pages, which can recurse into panthor's own
shrinker, so it is worth being explicit about what the early pass can
evict. There is no deadlock: drm_gem_lru_scan() acquires the resv with
ww_mutex_trylock() and skips what it cannot get. VM-exclusive BOs share
the VM resv, which is held across both passes, so those are always
skipped. External objects are not held by the early pass, though, so
reclaim can evict one while the early pass validates something else.

That is handled, and is why the late pass validates rather than only
locking: it picks up anything evicted after the early pass looked at it.
The cost is that the swapin for such a BO happens under the full set of
locks, i.e. it degrades to the current behaviour for that one object.

Xe avoids this by refusing to evict BOs bound to a VM the current task is
validating (xe_bo_eviction_valuable() and xe_vm_is_validating()). Panthor
has no equivalent guard. Adding one would make the split more effective
under memory pressure, but it is not needed for correctness, so it is left
as a follow up.
