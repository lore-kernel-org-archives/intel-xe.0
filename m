An UNMAP (or the unmap half of a REMAP) can leave a BO with no
remaining VMA mappings anywhere. Such a BO is unlikely to be touched
again soon, so rather than leaving it at whatever priority band it had
while still in active use, drop it to XE_BO_PRIORITY_LOW, the lowest
level, so it becomes one of the first candidates considered for
eviction/shrinking. This applies both to BOs private to a VM and to
extobjs shared across multiple VMs (bo->vm == NULL) -- an extobj with
no bindings left anywhere is just as good an eviction/shrink candidate
as an unmapped private BO. Imported bos are excluded, since their
vma_count is never tracked (xe_bo_vma_count_inc/dec_locked() are
no-ops for them), so it would never reflect anything meaningful.

This has to be done inside xe_vma_destroy() itself, right after
xe_bo_vma_count_dec_locked(), rather than by its callers after the
fact: xe_vma_destroy() may drop the last reference to the BO via
xe_bo_put() in xe_vma_destroy_late() (called either synchronously, or
asynchronously via a fence callback), so a caller that stashed a
pointer to the BO before calling xe_vma_destroy() and then dereferences
it afterwards risks a use-after-free. Doing the check and update
before that possible final put avoids this.

bo->purgeable.vma_count, which xe_bo_vma_count_dec_locked() just
updated, tells us whether the BO has become fully unmapped. A REMAP
that only shrinks a mapping still leaves vma_count > 0 via the
prev/next VMA(s) created earlier in the bind, so those are correctly
left untouched. This runs under the BO's dma-resv, already asserted
held via xe_bo_assert_held() just above.
