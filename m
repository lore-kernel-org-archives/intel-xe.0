    drm/xe/vf: Fixup CTB send buffer messages after migration
    
    During post-migration recovery of a VF, it is necessary to update
    GGTT references included in messages which are going to be sent
    to GuC. GuC will start consuming messages after VF KMD will inform
    it about fixups being done; before that, the VF KMD is expected
    to update any H2G messages which are already in send buffer but
    were not consumed by GuC.
    
    Only a small subset of messages allowed for VFs have GGTT references
    in them. This patch adds the functionality to parse the CTB send
    ring buffer and shift addresses contained within.
    
    While fixing the CTB content, ct->lock is not taken. This means
    the only barrier taken remains GGTT address lock - which is ok,
    because only requests with GGTT addresses matter, but it also means
    tail changes can happen during the CTB fixups execution (which may
    be ignored as any new messages will not have anything to fix).
    
    The GGTT address locking will be introduced in a future series.
    
    v2: removed storing shift as that's now done in VMA nodes patch;
      macros to inlines; warns to asserts; log messages fixes (Michal)
    v3: removed inline keywords, enums for offsets in CTB messages,
      less error messages, if return unused then made functs void (Michal)
    v4: update the cached head before starting fixups
    v5: removed/updated comments, wrapped lines, converted assert into
      error, enums for offsets to separate patch, reused xe_map_rd
    v6: define xe_map_*_array() macros, support CTB wrap which divides
      a message, updated comments, moved one function to an earlier patch
    v7: renamed few functions, wider use on previously introduced helper,
      separate cases in parsing messges, documented a static funct
    v8: Introduced more helpers, fixed coding style mistakes
