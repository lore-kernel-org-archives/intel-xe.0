There seems to be a bit of misunderstanding here.

Driver unbind removes the struct device from the driver, triggers
device unplug, and eventually the devres release actions. IIRC the last
devres action removes a *single reference* on the struct drm_device.=20
Hence if there exists other reference holders on the struct drm_device
(open files, exported dma-bufs, exported drm_pagemaps as an example),
the drm_device will survive the driver unbind. So will open files and
thus drm_gpuvms until user-space decides to remove them.

Files, dma-bufs and drm_pagemaps all hold a driver module reference
until they have successfully released the drm_device. The requirement
is "If a drm_device reference is held, a module reference of the driver
providing the drm_device must also be held, or if it's held by the
driver itself, it must ensure at driver unload time that any drm_device
references it holds are released and drmm release callbacks have
finished executing."

What this series in effect does is to change this to to "The driver
won't unload until all drm_device references are gone, and all drmm
release callbacks have finished executing."

I agree that the use of drm_gpuvm in the documentation is a bit unfair.
Since the code calling drm_dev_get() and drm_dev_put() is intended to
be called from the driver, the reference in effect becomes the driver's
responsibility, but if someone would, in the future change that so that
those references are put from a worker from within the driver or even
within drm_gpuvm itself, things would break. If a future code reviewer,
developer or AI agent knows about the new drm_device reference
guarantee, then that will lessen the review scope and code will become
more rubost.

The drmm release callbacks.

That is not true. See above. The alternative would be, as mentioned in
the commit message of patch 2, IIRC that each drm_device itself hold a
module reference of the creating module. But then you wouldn't be able
to execute rmmod with devices alive, You would have to manually unbind
all devices first.

I don't think that is correct either. Take a look at Matt Brost reply
to patch 3 there where he points out that the drm device (a base class
of the xe device) is acually referenced in a work item after the struct
drm_device reference is put. (There is a workqueue naming confusion in
xe, but I do believe that patch needs a fix). With the poposed series
in place a simple fix would be to hold a drm_device reference across
the workqueue item. The unload process would then block until all
devices are unreferenced, and then again at destroy_worqueue time
waiting for the work item epilogue to finish executing.

drm_release is not of major interest.

As previously mentioned, software device state may well outlive a
driver unbind. This is all about its cleanup.
