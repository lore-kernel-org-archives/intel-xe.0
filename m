I agree drm_fw_ is not great either. I think Philipp's name, JobQueue,
is a better fit.

Yeah, I'm pretty sure we can add a layer on top to deal with HW GPU
queues (Danilo and Philipp proposed it already), I'm just not sure it
should be our primary focus, at least not until we have something
usable for the drivers that are currently written in rust. Doesn't mean
we shouldn't think about it and design the thing so it can be added
later, of course, but most of the time, perfect is the enemy of good.

Let alone real-time GPU contexts, you still have the concept of context
priority in both GL and Vulkan, on which jobs with deps are likely to
be queued, and if the dequeuing thread doesn't take this priority into
consideration, there's nothing differentiating a low-prio from an
high-prio context, thus partially defeating the priority you assign to
your FW queue (you can execute fast, but if the queuing to the FW queue
is slow, it's pointless).

As for real-time contexts, yes, right now the only use case I can think
of is compositors, and apparently those would pass dep-less submissions,
but claiming that this is the only use case we'll ever have for those RT
contexts is a bit of a risk I'd rather not take. Also, if we solve the
problem with kthreads with prios, it might be that we don't even need
this fastpath in the first place.

One last note: I've seen a bunch of discussions that start to look like
some pissing contest between C and rust advocates. I've only started to
look at rust recently, in the context of Tyr (the rust re-implementation
of Panthor), and there's niceties in the language that I think make it
a good fit for the new JobQueue thing we've been discussing (Daniel
listed a bunch of them). I don't really mind who's going to end up
winning the trophy of this contest to be honest, but what I certainly
don't want is for us to be stuck with no solution at all because each
camp claims that their solution is best and none of them give up on
their ideas (basically what happened with the AGX driver). So please,
please, let's all take a step back, have a look at what each side has
done, keep the discussion constructive, and hopefully we'll end up with
a mix of ideas that makes the final solution better.

Regards,

Boris
