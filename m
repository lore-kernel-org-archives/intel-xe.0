Driver and drm helper code is increasingly relying on holding a bare
&drm_device reference (drm_dev_get()) without also holding a module
reference on the module that created the device.

For example drm_gpuvm_init() takes a drm_dev_get() reference on the
&drm_gpuvm's behalf with no accompanying module reference at all, and
drm_gpuvm_free() later calls the driver-supplied gpuvm->ops->vm_free()
callback, which lives in the driver module, before dropping that
reference. xe also takes bare drm_device references itself from
several asynchronous contexts, such as GuC submission fence workers,
EU stall, OA and PMU sampling code, relying only on those references
being dropped before the underlying xe_device, and eventually the
driver module, can be torn down.

If the module that created such a device is unloaded while one of
these bare references is still outstanding, and the corresponding
drm_dev_put() only completes after the module has already been
removed, the driver's ->release() callback, any drm managed release
actions, or a driver callback such as gpuvm->ops->vm_free(), all of
which live in that module's, by then freed, code, can end up being
invoked out of memory that no longer contains valid code.

Requiring every one of these bare drm_device references to also take a
module reference, as drm_pagemap does today via try_module_get(),
doesn't scale to shared helpers and driver-internal code with many
call sites, and is easy to get wrong.

Fix this properly by letting drivers keep a drm device-count and
ensure the module isn't unloaded until that count has dropped to zero
and until any release callback that had already started executing has
also finished executing.

To help with the latter, add a drm_dev_release_barrier() function.
The function ensures that any caller that has started executing
device release callbacks has also finished executing them.

Use SRCU for the implementation.

Rather than a single SRCU domain shared by all drivers, which would
mean drm_dev_release_barrier() could unnecessarily block a driver's
module unload on unrelated drivers' release callbacks, require each
driver that wants to use drm_dev_release_barrier() to supply its own
SRCU domain via a new &drm_driver.release_srcu field. Drivers should
define a static SRCU domain (DEFINE_STATIC_SRCU()) and set this field
to point at it. Leaving the field unset means @release and drm managed
release actions for that driver's devices simply aren't synchronized
against, and calling drm_dev_release_barrier() for such a driver is a
no-op that triggers a warning.

Since &drm_driver.release_srcu is a new field, every existing struct
drm_driver instance in the tree was scanned to confirm none of them
would leave it uninitialized with indeterminate content. All in-tree
instances have static storage duration (plain or const static
file-scope objects), or are members of a KUnit test fixture zeroed via
kunit_kzalloc(); no instance is stack-allocated or heap-allocated
without zeroing. Objects with static storage duration are guaranteed
by the C standard to have any member without an explicit initializer
zero-initialized, so the new field is reliably NULL, and
drm_dev_release() simply skips the SRCU critical section, for all
drivers that don't set it.
