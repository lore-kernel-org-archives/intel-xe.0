It’s very hard to take this seriously when I reply to threads saying
something breaks dma-fence rules and the response is, “what are
dma-fence rules?” Or I read through the jobqueue thread and see you
asking why a dma-fence would come from anywhere other than your own
driver — that’s the entire point of dma-fence; it’s a cross-driver
contract. I could go on, but I’d encourage you to take a hard look at
your understanding of DRM, and whether your responses — to me and to
others — are backed by the necessary technical knowledge.

Even better — what first annoyed me was your XDC presentation. You gave
an example of my driver modifying the pending list without a lock while
scheduling was stopped, and claimed you fixed a bug. That was not a bug
- Xe would explode if it was as we test our code. The pending list can
be modified without a lock if scheduling is stopped. I almost grabbed
the mic to correct you. Yes, it’s a layering violation, but presenting
it aa a bug shows a clear lack of understanding.

I’ve suggested ideas to fix DRM sched (refcounting, clear teardown
flows), but they were immediately met with resistance — typically from
Christian with you agreeing. My willingness to fight with Christian is
low; I really don’t need another person to argue with.

I’ll admit I’m busy with many other things, so my bandwidth is limited.
But again, if I chime in and explain how I solved something in Xe (e.g.,
refcounting) and it’s met with resistance, I’ll likely move on — I’ve
already solved it, and I’ll just let you fail (see cancel_job).

I'm glad you asked this, and it inspired me to fix this, more below [1].

drm/sched was ported from AMDGPU into common code. It carried many
AMDGPU-specific hacks, had no object-lifetime model thought out as a
common component, and included teardown nightmares that “worked,” but
other drivers immediately had to work around. With Christian involved —
who is notoriously hostile — everyone did their best to paper over
issues driver-side rather than get into fights and fix things properly.
Asahi Linux publicly aired grievances about this situation years ago.

See above.

Write sane code and test it. fwiw, Google shared a doc with me
indicating that Xe has unprecedented stability, and to be honest, when I
first wrote Xe I barely knew what I was doing — but I did know how to
test. I’ve since cleaned up most of my mistakes though.

So how can we do better... We can [1].

I started on [1] after you asking what the problems in DRM sched - which
got me thinking about what it would look like if we took the good parts
(stop/start control plane, dependency tracking, ordering, finished
fences, etc.), dropped the bad parts (no object-lifetime model, no
refcounting, overly complex queue teardown, messy fence manipulation,
hardware-scheduling baggage, lack of annotations, etc.), and wrote
something that addresses all of these problems from the start
specifically for firmware-scheduling models.

It turns out pretty good.

Main patch [2].

Xe is fully converted, tested, and working. AMDXNDA and Panthor are
compiling. Nouveau and PVR seem like good candidates to convert as well.
Rust bindings are also possible given the clear object model with
refcounting and well-defined object lifetimes.

Thinking further, hardware schedulers should be able to be implemented
on top of this by embedding the objects in [2] and layering a
backend/API on top.

Let me know if you have any feedback (off-list) before I share this
publicly. So far, Dave, Sima, Danilo, and the other Xe maintainers have
been looped in.
