I have a couple of additional patches to this series to ensure shmem
memory allocated as part of shrinking or swapout ends up accounted to
the same cgroup that allocated the TTM memory. It looks like recursive
per-cgroup shrinking is not an issue, since somebody thought about that
already.

The initial use-case for us is being able to pin rather substantial
amounts of system memory due to potential upcoming hardware features.
While RDMA is using RLIMIT_MEMLOCK for this, that is per process and an
attacker could easily launch a number of processes and pin all of
system memory, so the thing optionally protecting from the DoS is the
memcg limit. So regardless of whether we also account against
RLIMIT_MEMLOCK or not, we need an additional cgroups limit.

Moving forward, there also a need of limiting the amount of allocated
graphics memory only, due to the way certain apps behave when probing
for available memory. :/.

I have unfortunately missed large parts of the memcg vs dmemcg
discussion, but I asked Claude to fish out as much of the essentials as
possible from the mailing lists so I can read up.

Thanks,
Thomas
