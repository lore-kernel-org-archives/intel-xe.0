drm: Add drm_work_fence helper

This commit introduces drm_work_fence, a helper that queues a work item
when a dma-fence signals. It manages dma-fence callbacks, kref lifetime,
and workqueue dispatch.

[Severity: High]
Can this ops->destroy() callback be executed in hard IRQ context?

If a dma-fence callback races with driver teardown and queue_work() fails,
the final reference might be dropped directly from the IRQ callback:

drm_work_fence_cb() -> drm_work_fence_queue()

If queue_work() returns false, drm_work_fence_put() drops the last reference
here, triggering this destroy callback under the dma-fence spinlock with
IRQs disabled.

> +	if (!queue_work(wfence->wq, &wfence->work))
> +		drm_work_fence_put(wfence);

[Severity: High]
Is there a use-after-free risk if wfence->wq is accessed here during a
concurrent driver teardown?

This relies on drm_work_fence_cancel_sync() successfully synchronizing
against the callback. However, if the synchronization fails, wfence->wq
could be accessed after the workqueue has been destroyed by the caller.

> +	if (drm_work_fence_cancel(wfence))
> +		return;
> +	if (disable_work_sync(&wfence->work))
> +		drm_work_fence_put(wfence);
> +}

[Severity: High]
Does this provide the expected synchronous cancellation guarantee, or does
it leave a window for concurrent execution during teardown?

If the dma-fence signals, the callback is dequeued but hasn't called
queue_work() yet. If drm_work_fence_cancel_sync() is called concurrently:

1. drm_work_fence_cancel() calls dma_fence_remove_callback(), which
   returns false because the callback is already dequeued.
2. disable_work_sync() returns false immediately because the work is
   not yet queued.
3. The function returns, falsely indicating the work is fully canceled.

This allows the driver teardown to proceed while the in-flight callback
might then call queue_work() on a potentially destroyed workqueue.
