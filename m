I was going to say.

It seems a bit specific, because different things might have a different use for
'pages with refcounts that shouldn't be touched by core mm' and different
semantics perhaps.

Obviously if it was a different memdesc type then it'd not be a folio.

Yeah the thing is we need some clarification on what is a folio exactly.

	A folio is a physically, virtually and logically contiguous set of
	bytes.  It is a power-of-two in size, and it is aligned to that same
	power-of-two.  It is at least as large as %PAGE_SIZE.  If it is in the
	page cache, it is at a file offset which is a multiple of that
	power-of-two.  It may be mapped into userspace at an address which is at
	an arbitrary page offset, but its kernel virtual address is aligned to
	its size.

By that definition a compound page _is_ a folio. And anything that _could_ be
mapped into userland.

But if we are going to say folio == rmappable then can we actually update the
description of folio to say so?

Or perhaps reference the fact that 'transitionally' it is as above, but in
future will mean only rmappable.

Yes.

Ha! I read this after making this very same suggestion. High.. 5?

But yeah obviously agree.

Yup.
