Since you mention DRM GPUVM in a couple of places, how can this ever happen=
? It
wouldn't make sense to keep a VM alive beyond driver unbind. I.e. it can't =
make
its drm_device reference count reach module unload in the first place.

Besides that, can you please remind me whether there are any other reasons =
than
the release() callback why a DRM device must not outlive module unload?

I don't think the correct solution is to constrain module unload. The relea=
se()
callback shouldn't really do anything other than free the memory of the
drm_device allocation. All other resources a driver may have should be rele=
ased
on driver unbind.

There may be shared resources, such as e.g. a common workqueue, but those a=
re
module level things that have nothing to do with the DRM device.

I am aware that a few drivers implement release(), but TBH it looks pretty
broken. qxl_drm_release() is a great example, and it already calls it out
itself.

Please see above; I also wonder why Xe cares in the first place. Xe doesn't
implement release(), no?

Huh? GPUVM tracks the GPU's VA space mappings, but after driver unbind ther=
e's
no access to the GPU to manage anything anymore. How can this even work?

Thanks,
