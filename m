Ah yes, if we get -ENOMEM we'd rollback or if we get TTM eviction to
part of the WW transaction, we'd also could rollback on lock contention
alone.

I thought it was an ugly workaround so VM bind on particular BO wouldn't
evict any other BO bound in the VM. 'git format-patch -1 9d5558649f68e'.
I think happens to also do what we want here but perhaps we shouldn't
extend this further.

Yes, the shrinker does look to be trylock so we are good there.

So I think this should discussed in a standalone follow up as this is
global choice for dma-resv.
