Pining for the days when all we had to deal with was checkpatch. =20


Mika, afaict the entire patchset is a performance optimization, yet you
say "I don't have a benchmark showing a gain".

Recipients look at patchsets wondering "why should I spend time on
this", especially in these times.  It's best to answer this question
right there in the first sentence of the [0/N].  That means numbers,
and the better they are, the more attention the patchset will get.
