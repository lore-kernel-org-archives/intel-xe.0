IIRC priority is used to calculate how many pages we are requested to
shrink compared to the number we say we have available, but that needs
to be double-checked. FWIW i915 has a check that xe's shrinker lacks,
that shrinking is not attempted unless the number of pages requested is
>=3D an average buffer object size.
