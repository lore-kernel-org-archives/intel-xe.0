Done - v2 is out with the Wa_22016122933 implementation mirroring i915:
scoped via an OOB rule to the media GT on media version 13.00, with
coverage modeled on intel_guc_allocate_vma() (CTBs, GuC log, ADS and
SLPC shared data):

https://lore.kernel.org/intel-xe/20260813023016.805573-1-talesam@gmail.com/

Validated on both ARL machines here for several days - details in the
cover letter.

Thanks,
Tales
