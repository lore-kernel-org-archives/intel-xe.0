mm/hmm: migrate collection in HMM pagewalk - pmd level

This commit implements hmm_vma_handle_migrate_prepare_pmd() and integrates =
it
into hmm_vma_walk_pmd() to prepare PMD-level THP and device-private entries
for migration or split them for PTE re-walking.

[Severity: High]
Can returning -EBUSY from the split path in
hmm_vma_handle_migrate_prepare_pmd() leave stale pre-split PMD entries in
range->hmm_pfns[] across the re-walk?

When migration is enabled (in the later commit "mm: enable device page
migration from HMM pagewalk"), hmm_vma_walk_pmd() first calls
hmm_vma_handle_pmd() or hmm_vma_handle_absent_pmd() before calling
hmm_vma_handle_migrate_prepare_pmd():

mm/hmm.c:hmm_vma_walk_pmd()
  hmm_vma_handle_pmd() / hmm_vma_handle_absent_pmd()
    for (i =3D 0; addr < end; addr +=3D PAGE_SIZE, i++, pfn++) {
        hmm_pfns[i] &=3D HMM_PFN_INOUT_FLAGS;
        hmm_pfns[i] |=3D pfn | cpu_flags;
    }
  hmm_vma_handle_migrate_prepare_pmd()

This populates hmm_pfns_start[0..npages-1] with the pre-split PMD PFNs,
HMM_PFN_VALID, HMM_PFN_WRITE, and hmm_pfn_flags_order(PMD_SHIFT - PAGE_SHIF=
T).

When hmm_vma_handle_migrate_prepare_pmd() then takes the split path (for
example, when MIGRATE_VMA_SELECT_COMPOUND is not set, [start, end) is small=
er
than HPAGE_PMD_SIZE, or set_pmd_migration_entry() fails), it drops
hmm_vma_walk->ptl, splits the folio via __migrate_vma_split_folio() (which
also unlocks the folio when folio !=3D fault_folio), sets
hmm_vma_walk->last =3D start, and returns -EBUSY without clearing
hmm_pfns_start[0..npages-1].

This breaks the hmm_range_fault_locked() expectation that range->hmm_pfns[]
entries at or after hmm_vma_walk.last have not been overwritten with output
flags when -EBUSY is returned.

On the subsequent PTE re-walk of [start, end), if any split page is
concurrently turned into a migration entry while the page table and folio
locks were dropped (with HMM_PFN_REQ_FAULT set), hmm_vma_handle_pte() retur=
ns
0 without updating *hmm_pfn:

mm/hmm.c:hmm_vma_handle_pte()
  if (softleaf_is_migration(entry)) {
      if (!hmm_select_migrate(range)) {
          ...
          return -EBUSY;
      }
      return 0;
  }

and hmm_vma_handle_migrate_prepare() sees !pte_present(pte) and
!softleaf_is_device_private(entry) and also returns 0 without updating
*hmm_pfn (similarly, if the PMD became a PMD migration entry,
hmm_vma_walk_pmd() returns 0 without clearing hmm_pfns_start). The later
commit "mm/hmm: implement rollback for device page migration in HMM pagewal=
k"
only rolls back entries that have both HMM_PFN_VALID and HMM_PFN_MIGRATE se=
t,
so these pre-split entries (which lack HMM_PFN_MIGRATE) remain in
range->hmm_pfns[], allowing callers that map non-migrated HMM PFNs in place
(such as nouveau_dmem_migrate_fault()) to map a stale 2MB host range into t=
he
device MMU.

Furthermore, if a caller sets range->pfn_flags_mask, overwriting
hmm_pfns_start[0..npages-1] with HMM_PFN_VALID (which shares its bit positi=
on
with HMM_PFN_REQ_FAULT) and HMM_PFN_WRITE (which shares its bit position wi=
th
HMM_PFN_REQ_WRITE) before the split clobbers the per-page request flags for
the PTE re-walk.

[Severity: Medium]
Should the folio_trylock() failure path in
hmm_vma_handle_migrate_prepare_pmd() and the split failure path here in
hmm_vma_walk_pmd() preserve the valid PFNs in range->hmm_pfns[] instead of
overwriting them with HMM_PFN_ERROR?

Before hmm_vma_handle_migrate_prepare_pmd() is called, hmm_vma_handle_pmd()
(or hmm_vma_handle_absent_pmd()) has already populated
hmm_pfns_start[0..npages-1] with the valid PFNs (HMM_PFN_VALID without
HMM_PFN_MIGRATE).

However, in two best-effort migration skip cases, those valid PFNs are
clobbered with HMM_PFN_ERROR:

1. In hmm_vma_handle_migrate_prepare_pmd(), when folio_trylock(folio) fails
   while holding hmm_vma_walk->ptl, it calls
   hmm_pfns_fill(start, end, hmm_vma_walk, HMM_PFN_ERROR) even though the P=
MD
   lock was never dropped and the mapping is still valid.

2. When compound migration is not selected or [start, end) is smaller than
   HPAGE_PMD_SIZE (such as single-page faults in nouveau_dmem_migrate_fault=
()
   in the later commit "drm/nouveau/svm: add support for migrate on fault"),
   hmm_vma_handle_migrate_prepare_pmd() jumps to split and calls
   __migrate_vma_split_folio(). If split_folio() fails (for example, when t=
he
   THP is pinned or has extra references), it returns -EFAULT and
   hmm_vma_walk_pmd() overwrites the range with HMM_PFN_ERROR.

By contrast, the other non-migrating exits in
hmm_vma_handle_migrate_prepare_pmd() (goto out) and folio_trylock() failure
at the PTE level in hmm_vma_handle_migrate_prepare():

mm/hmm.c:hmm_vma_handle_migrate_prepare()
	if (fault_folio =3D=3D folio || folio_trylock(folio)) {
		...
	} else {
		folio_put(folio);
	}
out:
	return 0;

leave range->hmm_pfns[] with the valid PFNs and without HMM_PFN_MIGRATE.
Because migrate_hmm_range_setup() only collects entries with HMM_PFN_MIGRATE
set, leaving the valid PFNs intact still skips migration while allowing
callers such as nouveau_dmem_migrate_fault() to map the present THP in place
instead of treating it as an error and falling back to a redundant page tab=
le
walk and GPU PFNMAP ioctl.

Could both skip paths return 0 without calling hmm_pfns_fill(...,
HMM_PFN_ERROR)?
