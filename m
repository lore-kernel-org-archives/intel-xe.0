It certainly sounds that this series will result in performance
improvements, but have those improvements been quantified?

Oh.  I didn't get that message from the v14 changelogs, and crashes in
the current implementation are not what we want.  In fact, addressing
those is more important than speeding things up.

Under what circumstances to these crashes occur?  Can/should we we fix
those in a minimal -stable backportable fashion before moving on to speedup=
s?
