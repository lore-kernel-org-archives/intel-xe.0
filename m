I'm talking about the drm_dep_queue_run_job_queue() call which in turn
calls queue_work() when a job gets reported as done. That, I think, is
the most likely path, isn't it?

I'm not talking about the signalling of the done_fence, but the work
that's used to check progress on a job queue
(drm_dep_queue_run_job_queue()).

That's orthogonal to the rule that says nothing after _arm() can
fail, I think. To guarantee proper job ordering, you need extra locking
(at the moment, we rely on the VM resv lock to serialize this in
Panthor).

If we can have that INACTIVE flag added, and the associated
dma_fence_init[64]_inactive() variants, I would say, we call
dma_fence_init[64]_inactive() in _arm(), and we call
dma_fence_set_active() in _push(). It'd still be valuable to have some
sort of delimitation for the submission through some block-like macro
with an associated context to which we can attach states and allow for
more (optional?) runtime-checks.

This sounds like a different issue to me. That's the constraint that
says _arm() and _push() ordering needs to be preserved to guarantee
that jobs are properly ordered on the job queue. But that's orthogonal
to the rule that says nothing between _arm() and _push() on a given job
can fail. Let's take the Panthor case as an example:

	for_each_job_in_batch() {
		// This acquires the VM resv lock, and all BO locks
		// Because queues target a specific VM and all jobs
		// in the a SUBMIT must target the same VM, this
		// guarantees that seqno allocation happening further
		// down (when _arm() is called) won't be interleaved
		// with other concurrent submissions to the same queues.
		lock_and_prepare_resvs()

		<--- Seqno critical section starts here
	}

 	for_each_job_in_batch() {
		// If something fails here, we drop all the jobs that
		// are part of this SUBMIT, and the resv locks are
		// released as part of the rollback. This means we
		// consumed but didn't use the seqnos, thus creating
		// a whole on the timeline, which is armless, as long
		// as those seqnos are not recycled.
		ret =3D faillible_stuf()
 		if (ret)
 			goto rollback;
=20
 		arm(job)
 	}
=20
 	// Nothing can fail after this point
=20
 	for_each_job_in_batch() {
		// resv locks are released here, unblocking other
		// concurrent submissions
 		update_resvs(job->done_fence)

		<--- Seqno critical section ends here in case of success

 		push(job)
 	}
=20
	update_submit_syncobjs();

rollback:
	unlock_resvs()
	<--- Seqno critical section ends here in case of success
...

How wide your critical seqno section is is up to each driver, really.

I agree it's a bit more work. It implies patching containers to reject
insertion when the INACTIVE flag is set. If we keep !INACTIVE as the
default (__dma_fence_init(INACTIVE) being an opt-in), fence emitters can
be moved to this model progressively though.
