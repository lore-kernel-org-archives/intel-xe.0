This is just a repost with a number of sashiko identified problems that I f=
ixed.

I committed the vmstat counters and list lru changes, and they are now in t=
ree.

This is the remainder of this series. Intel have expressed interest in gett=
ing
this landed for xe, we can drop the amdgpu changes for now if they can't ge=
t
across the line.

I've dropped all previous acks/reviews.

This series adds the memcg counters for GPU active and GPU reclaim to align
with the two global vmstats. It adds an accounting flag to TTM alloc/popula=
te,
and enables memcg tracking and shrinker support in TTM.

Then it adds amdgpu and xe support.

I think for this to land, Christian holds the main objection which I still =
fail
to fully understand beyond it doesn't solve all the problems we ever have h=
ad
with cgroups and drm, so we shouldn't even bother, and maybe we could do it=
 at
the object level, and integrated with dmem, and android cross process accou=
nting,
but I still feel this is a good baseline.

I think this is the right layer to hook this into TTM, where we allocate me=
mory
and I think accounting for this memory in a proper way should be done.

Intel folks (Thomas/Maarten) please review and express concerns as well.

Regards,
Dave.
