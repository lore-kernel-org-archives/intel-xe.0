Wouldn't the net effect be that content stays put instead of being
migrated? In both cases a later CPU access will not trigger NUMA
hinting except that the proposed change doesn't send content to an
irrelevant node?

Perhaps we could force hmm_range_fault() to run on the node closest to
the GPU. Then at least the migration might be beneficial.

We could ofc look at that. Might help in some cases.

Thanks,
