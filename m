Thank you for your contribution! Sashiko AI review found 2 potential issue(=
s) to consider:
- [High] drm_user_fence_cancel() causes a Use-After-Free if the fence has s=
ignaled, because it requires the caller to pass a fence pointer without req=
uiring the caller to hold a separate reference.
- [High] Contradictory documentation in drm_user_fence_cancel() instructs t=
he caller to put references that the function already puts internally, lead=
ing to double-free bugs.

drm: Add common drm_user_fence helper

This commit introduces a common DRM user fence helper providing a pattern
to access userspace memory from a kthread context when a GPU fence signals.
It implements a kref-managed, dma-fence-callback-to-workqueue pattern that
borrows the process MM.

[Severity: High]
The kernel-doc instructions here state that the caller must call
drm_user_fence_put() and dma_fence_put() upon success.

However, looking at the implementation of drm_user_fence_cancel() below,
it internally executes dma_fence_put() and drm_user_fence_put() before
returning true.

If a driver strictly follows this documentation, will it lead to double-free
bugs when they try to drop the references again?

> +{
> +	if (dma_fence_remove_callback(fence, &ufence->cb)) {

[Severity: High]
Can this result in a use-after-free if the fence has already signaled?

According to the drm_user_fence_add_callback() design, the caller transfers
its fence reference to the callback. If the fence signals asynchronously, t=
he
callback fires and internally drops that reference via dma_fence_put(). If
that was the last reference, the fence object is freed.

When the driver later initiates teardown and calls drm_user_fence_cancel(),
it passes this potentially dangling fence pointer to
dma_fence_remove_callback(), which dereferences it to acquire a spinlock.

Is there a way for the caller to safely cancel the callback without taking
and holding an additional reference to the fence?
