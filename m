    mm/hmm: preparations for HMM to participate in migration
   =20
    For migration to happen after hmm_range_fault(), the vma has to
    retrieved. Luckily, pagewalk already resolves that for us, so
    just have to save it for further use. For migration, mmap_lock
    has to be hold for the whole operation, so vma stays stable.

[Severity: High]
Is the tracked start address unconditionally overwritten on every walk rest=
art?

If the walk requires a retry, returning -EBUSY, the outer loop restarts
walk_page_range() from the intermediate faulting address. On retry, could t=
his
clobber the tracking start with the intermediate address, leading to a
truncated start address?

[Severity: High]
Could using the owner field as an initialization flag be problematic here?

If range->dev_private_owner is legitimately NULL, mmu_range.owner becomes
NULL. If a page fault retry occurs, the check passes again, causing a
duplicate mmu_notifier_invalidate_range_start(). Can this cause unbalanced
MMU notifier invalidation?

[Severity: High]
Are we missing a call to mmu_notifier_invalidate_range_end() if the owner is
NULL?

Assuming a NULL owner means the invalidation was never started could
permanently leak the invalidation if dev_private_owner is legitimately NULL.

[Severity: High]
Will this propagate the truncated start address back to the caller's migrat=
ion
struct?

If the walk was retried and the start address was clobbered in
hmm_vma_capture_migrate_range(), it could cause the migration setup to
miscalculate the page count and read from the wrong array offset.

[Severity: High]
How does this API change affect hmm_range_fault_unlocked_timeout()?

The patch modifies the HMM API to allow range->notifier to be NULL for
migration entry points, handling it gracefully here with
hmm_range_fault_mm(). However, looking at hmm_range_fault_unlocked_timeout()
in mm/hmm.c:

int hmm_range_fault_unlocked_timeout(struct hmm_range *range,
                                     unsigned long timeout)
{
        struct mm_struct *mm =3D range->notifier->mm;

It unconditionally dereferences range->notifier->mm at its very first line.=
 Can
this trigger a NULL pointer dereference if driver code passes a migration r=
ange
with a NULL notifier to the unlocked variant?
