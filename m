As Daniel pointed out already, with Christian's recent changes to
dma_fence (the ones that reset dma_fence::ops after ::signal()), the
fence proxy that existed in drm_sched_fence is no longer required:
drivers and their implementations can safely vanish even if some fences
they have emitted are still referenced by other subsystems. All we need
is:

- fence must be signaled for dma_fence::ops to be set back to NULL
- no .cleanup and no .wait implementation

There might be an interest in having HW submission fences reflecting
when the job is passed to the FW/HW queue, but that can done as a
separate fence implementation using a different fence timeline/context.

Just want to clear the confusion and make sure I get this right at the
same time. To me, "process context" means a user thread entering some
syscall(). What you call "process context" is more a "thread context" to
me. I'm actually almost certain it's always a kernel thread (a workqueue
worker thread to be accurate) that executes the drop_deps() after a
run_job().

Why do we need to make a difference here. Can't we just assume that the
hole drm_dep_job_fini() call is unsafe in atomic context, and have a
work item embedded in the job to defer its destruction when _put() is
called in a context where the destruction is not allowed?

I'd really like DMA-signalling-path annotation to be something that
doesn't leak to the job object. The way I see it, in the submit path,
it should be some sort of block initializing an opaque token, and
drm_dep_job_arm() should expect a valid token to be passed, thus
guaranteeing that anything between arm and push, and more generally
anything in that section is safe.

	struct drm_job_submit_context submit_ctx;

	// Do all the prep stuff, pre-alloc, resv setup, ...

	// Non-faillible section of the submit starts here.
	// This is properly annotated with
	// dma_fence_{begin,end}_signalling() to ensure we're
	// not taking locks or doing allocations forbidden in
	// the signalling path
	drm_job_submit_non_faillible_section(&submit_ctx) {
		for_each_job() {
			drm_dep_job_arm(&submit_ctx, &job);

			// pass the armed fence around, if needed

			drm_dep_job_push(&submit_ctx, &job);
		}
	}

With the current solution, there's no control that
drm_dep_job_{arm,push}() calls are balanced, with the risk of leaving a
DMA-signalling annotation behind.

Just FYI, Panthor doesn't have this {begin,end}_signalling() in the
submit path. If we were to add it, it would be around the
panthor_submit_ctx_push_jobs() call, which might seem broken. In
practice I don't think it is because we don't expose fences to the
outside world until all jobs have been pushed. So what happens is that
a job depending on a previous job in the same batch-submit has the
armed-but-not-yet-pushed fence in its deps, and that's the only place
where this fence is present. If something fails on a subsequent job
preparation in the next batch submit, the rollback logic will just drop
the jobs on the floor, and release the armed-but-not-pushed-fence,
meaning we're not leaking a fence that will never be signalled. I'm in
no way saying this design is sane, just trying to explain why it's
currently safe and works fine.

In general, I wonder if we should distinguish between "armed" and
"publicly exposed" to help deal with this intra-batch dep thing without
resorting to reservation and other tricks like that.

You don't seem to go for the
replace-if-earlier-fence-on-same-context-exists optimization that we
have in drm_dep_job_add_dependency(). Any reason not to?
