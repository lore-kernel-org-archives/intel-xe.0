It doesn't have to in a model where all users are removed before the
drm device is freed. Following your argument, shouldn't that drm_device
reference should also be accompanied by a module reference? Except that
will block rmmod?

Without knowing for sure, I think this was the route taken with

But isn't essentially what you describe a design where we release all
dma_buf, file- and drm_pagemap references of struct drm_device at
module_unload time. That would replace their references with SRCU
protecting the drm_device pointer, falling back to a stub behaviour
when unbind has been called. So the "Can I access hardware?" would be
replaced by a "Can I access the DRM device?".=20

That's an interesting idea, but would probably need careful work so
fence waits etc. doesn't block the SRCU read sections. And ofc to avoid
user-space regressing.

FWIW, IIRC that SRCU is only strictly needed when non-driver code
(pagemap, files and dma-buf) drops the last drm_device reference
without having a module reference. And there is no such code (yet)
AFAIK, so I can drop that patch to when we think it's necessary and we
have other driver buy-ins.
