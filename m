[Severity: High]
Can allowing vrr.enable on joined pipes trigger a NULL pointer dereference
in intel_crtc_needs_joined_update() when another pipe's modeset changes the
DDB allocation of only one of the joined pipes?

On DISPLAY_VER >=3D 13, PIPE_A uses DBUF_S1|DBUF_S2 while PIPE_B shares
DBUF_S3|DBUF_S4 with PIPE_C. If PIPE_A and PIPE_B are joined with VRR
active and an atomic commit enables or disables PIPE_C,
intel_joiner_add_affected_crtcs() runs before watermark calculation when
neither PIPE_A nor PIPE_B is in the atomic state. Later,
intel_compute_global_watermarks() -> skl_compute_wm() -> skl_compute_ddb()
-> skl_crtc_allocate_ddb() adds only PIPE_B to the atomic state because
PIPE_A's DDB slices and entry did not change. During commit,
intel_update_crtc() calls intel_crtc_needs_joined_update(), which loops over
intel_crtc_joined_pipe_mask(new_crtc_state) and dereferences NULL for
PIPE_A:

drivers/gpu/drm/i915/display/intel_display.c:intel_crtc_needs_joined_update=
() {
    ...
	for_each_intel_crtc_in_pipe_mask(display, pipe_crtc,
					 intel_crtc_joined_pipe_mask(new_crtc_state)) {
		const struct intel_crtc_state *old_pipe_crtc_state =3D
			intel_atomic_get_old_crtc_state(state, pipe_crtc);
		const struct intel_crtc_state *new_pipe_crtc_state =3D
			intel_atomic_get_new_crtc_state(state, pipe_crtc);

		/* The DSB and the flip queue do their own vblank evasion */
		if (new_pipe_crtc_state->commit_type !=3D INTEL_COMMIT_MMIO)
			return false;
    ...
}

[Severity: High]
When a joined pipe's DDB allocation changes while VRR is enabled, does
falling back to per-pipe updates in skl_commit_modeset_enables() break VRR
push sequencing?

In intel_crtc_needs_joined_update(), a changed wm.skl.ddb on any joined pipe
returns false so skl_commit_modeset_enables() commits the pipes one at a
time, while intel_vrr_send_push() unconditionally returns early when
intel_crtc_is_joiner_secondary(crtc_state) is true:

drivers/gpu/drm/i915/display/intel_display.c:skl_commit_modeset_enables() {
    ...
			intel_update_crtc(state, crtc);

			if (!skl_ddb_entry_equal(&new_crtc_state->wm.skl.ddb,
						 &old_crtc_state->wm.skl.ddb) &&
			    (update_pipes | modeset_pipes))
				intel_crtc_wait_for_next_vblank(crtc);
    ...
}

When the joiner secondary is committed first and its DDB changed,
intel_update_crtc() arms the secondary without sending a VRR push, and
skl_commit_modeset_enables() immediately waits for the next vblank before
updating the primary pipe, stalling until VMAX and latching the secondary a
frame ahead of the primary. Conversely, if skl_ddb_allocation_overlaps()
orders the joiner primary before the secondary, the primary sends its push
and waits for vblank in the first pass, and the secondary's subsequent
update never receives a push at all.
