Before starting to look at this, in the spirit of trying to aligning on
a "final" solution for ww transactions used in TTM, could we agree on
how we are supposed to pass the importer's ww transaction context to
the exporter's dma_map_attachment() operation to handle exporter
evictions while mapping, because that decides what abstaction we should
use for WW transations within TTM.

drm_exec_init()
xe_bo_validate() // IMporter
dma_buf_map()    // importer;
map_attachment() // callback in exporter
xe_bo_validate() // exporter tries to move exportert bo to VRAM but
runs out of memory.
ttm_bo_evict()   // exporter's evict needs importer's drm_exec

As mentioned a couple of times before, we can't pass a drm_exec to the
exporter because that would make dma-buf depend on drm.

So with this series it would be sufficient to move drm_exec to the dma-
buf layer and rename it, but I still think we should have a plan.

Thanks,
Thomas
