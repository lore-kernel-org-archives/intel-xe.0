Some questions about the design that might belong in the cover-letter.

- First, Since from my understanding gpu shmem allocations are charged
against memcg, (i915 igfx and to some extent dgfx), I think this makes
sense, although it would be good to have an outlook:

1) What about system memory allocations targeting suspend / hibernate
evictions, will they be charged against the root cgroup?

2) Plan for limits on total gpu pages / pinned gpu pages? Is dmemcg a
fit for such limits (coexisting with memcg) or should such limits be
implemented in memcg?

3) IIRC I noticed a patch for dma-heaps where dmemcg was suggested for
android, since it separates GPU memory and system memory. Do we plan
simething similar here, based on config options?

Thanks,
Thomas
