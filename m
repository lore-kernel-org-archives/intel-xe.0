The selection of the number of lanes or link rate are at the discretion
of the driver, or link policy manager in DP spec terms. It does not
really convey the capabilities of the *connectors* but rather the
current *link*. Ditto for enabling DSC.

I don't think the voltage swing and pre-emphasis are really diagnostic
measures either, but a response to measuring and adapting to the
link. And if the link training failed, the driver may have already
reduced the number of lanes and link rate to compensate. So you could
appear to have the perfect link only because it was so bad at high link
rate that it was reduced already.

The policies may also vary from driver to driver, and possibly depending
on what makes sense for the hardware (e.g. power consumption with or
without DSC).

I think "link information report ... requested by OSs" is vague, and I
don't think the concept has been completely thought through. I can't see
how you could present reliable and actionable information to the user
with what the patch at hand provides. Or how it could work in a generic
manner across drivers.

Overall sounds like an XY problem [1]. We should focus on what you're
trying to achieve first, in userspace, and only then think about what
the appropriate kernel mechanism should be.

I don't think this is it.
