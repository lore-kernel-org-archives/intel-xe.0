Driver and drm helper code is increasingly relying on holding a bare
&drm_device reference (drm_dev_get()) without also holding a module
reference on the module that created the device.

For example drm_gpuvm_init() takes a drm_dev_get() reference on the
&drm_gpuvm's behalf with no accompanying module reference at all, and
drm_gpuvm_free() later calls the driver-supplied gpuvm->ops->vm_free()
callback, which lives in the driver module, before dropping that
reference. xe also takes bare drm_device references itself from
several asynchronous contexts, such as GuC submission fence workers,
EU stall, OA and PMU sampling code, relying only on those references
being dropped before the underlying xe_device, and eventually the
driver module, can be torn down.

If the module that created such a device is unloaded while one of
these bare references is still outstanding, and the corresponding
drm_dev_put() only completes after the module has already been
removed, the driver's ->release() callback, any drm managed release
actions, or a driver callback such as gpuvm->ops->vm_free(), all of
which live in that module's, by then freed, code, can end up being
invoked out of memory that no longer contains valid code.

Requiring every one of these bare drm_device references to also take a
module reference, as drm_pagemap does today via try_module_get(),
doesn't scale to shared helpers and driver-internal code with many
call sites, and is easy to get wrong.

Fix this properly by letting drivers keep a drm device-count and
ensure the module isn't unloaded until that count has dropped to zero
and until any release callback that had already started executing has
also finished executing.

To help with the latter, add a drm_dev_release_barrier() function.
The function ensures that any caller that has started executing
device release callbacks has also finished executing them.

Use SRCU for the implementation, with a single, global SRCU domain
shared by all drivers. This means a driver's call to
drm_dev_release_barrier() may occasionally end up waiting for an
unrelated driver's release callback to finish, but release callbacks
are expected to run quickly, and sharing one domain avoids the
bookkeeping that a per-driver SRCU domain would require, such as
adding a new &drm_driver field that every existing struct drm_driver
instance in the tree would need to be audited for, and initializing
and cleaning up that domain around driver (un)registration.

v2:
- Use plain WARN_ON_ONCE() instead of drm_WARN_ON_ONCE(NULL, ...) in
  drm_dev_release_barrier(), since passing a NULL drm_device caused
  the warning path itself to dereference that NULL pointer inside
  dev_driver_string()/dev_name() (sashiko)

v3:
- Use a single, global SRCU domain shared by all drivers instead of
  requiring each driver to supply its own via a new
  &drm_driver.release_srcu field, accepting that a driver's call to
  drm_dev_release_barrier() may then occasionally block on unrelated
  drivers' release callbacks (Christian König)
