From what I found both success and fail cases are logged here.

        if (check_boot_failure(xe))
                xe_log_err_fatal(pdev, SURVIVABILITY, 0, "Boot Mode enabled!\n");
        else
                xe_log_info(pdev, SURVIVABILITY, "Boot Mode enabled!\n");

These logs use SURVIVABILITY as a component which would appear in dmesg
(not a fan of it myself, but that's unfortunately the xe_log design).

I do agree that we could log something like "Entering survivability mode"
somewhere if xe_survivability_mode_is_requested() were to return true,
unless Riana has a better idea.
