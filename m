True, but there are other complications. Let's say at map time there is
another importer that don't support anything but system memory dma-
bufs. Then both ualink and PCIe p2p could not be used, and we'd fall
back to system. Or a map() move to VRAM from system for a fast
interconnect failed for some reason. (Somebody might have pinned it in
system).

But agreed it sounds to me like the interconnect capabilities should be
fixed at attach time.

It was that mellanox ATS thing, right? That's the only case I heard of
that needed the mapping type decision (or at least a strong hint)
early.
