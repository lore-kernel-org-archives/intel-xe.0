I do understand this line of thinking.

Yes, want to add that too for C (ofc this can't be enforced at compile time).

I've started on this here [1]

Yea, my bad. I apologize. This shouldn't be about is Rust or C better.

I'll copy paste my reply from [2].

The only weird case I haven't wrapped my head around quite yet is the
ganged submissions that rely on the scheduled fence (PVR, AMDGPU do
this). Pretty much every other driver seems like it could be coverted
with what I have in place in this series + local work to provide a
hardware scheduler...

I can get other drivers to compile but I can't do things like test these
changes for other vendors. Also if existing drivers break dma-fencing
rules, those would need to fixed when converting over too.

The fact is we can't maintain DRM sched as it is now, techincal debt is
just too high.

I'd say I agree with your no new features statement in DRM sched, if you
want new features in C, fix your driver to use what I have here.

Ofc if bugs pop up in drm sched, happy help fix those.

I agree with this statement. So it would require disciplined reviews...

e.g., You are touching this struct directly - why? Is is drm dep missing
something in the API your driver needs, if it is real issue we add to
drm dep.

That is not my intent. I did write this as common component for driver
and to used by the community.

DRM sched is not maintainable, thus it is not going to fit the needs of
Xe in the longterm. Other drivers like are facing similar issues.
