As far as I see, the problem is that the minimal CDCLK is reflected in 
the initial crtc_state, but there is no direct connection to the actual 
(hardware) CDCLK, which can be lower at this point. I'll add some more 
details below.

Makes sense, I've filed 
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/i915/kernel/-/work_items/16209 for that.

As far as I see, the CDCLK is updated based on / for an atomic change in 
the following way: intel_atomic_check calls intel_cdclk_atomic_check to 
update the CDCLK iff needed. In order to find out if a CDCLK calc is 
needed, intel_cdclk_atomic_check in turn (via intel_cdclk_atomic_check 
and intel_crtcs_calc_min_cdclk) calls intel_cdclk_update_crtc_min_cdclk. 
In intel_cdclk_update_crtc_min_cdclk, the old and the new min_cdclk get 
compared, and if there's a change, the CDCLK will be recalculated.

The issue here is that we start out with the min_cdclk set (to 158400 in 
the GLK case) in the initial / old atomic state (which is not reflected 
in the actual / hardware state). Thus intel_cdclk_update_crtc_min_cdclk 
won't be able to detect a change here (as both the old and the new 
atomic state have the same min_cdclk), and thus won't indicate that the 
CDCLK needs to be recalculated (even though the actual CDCLK might be 
lower as min_cdclk, as can be seen on the dmesg attached in the ticket).

If you want to see this addressed in another way, I'm happy to provide 
another patch. Also I'm happy to provide more details, if needed.

See beb29980026f / 
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20190430125119.7478-1-stanislav.lisovskiy@intel.com/ 
and the tickets linked from there for context here. See also 
cf696856bc54, which fixed a regression related to this Gemini Lake quirk 
before.

I've bisected this problem to ba91b9eecb47 initially, and naively adding 
the intel_modeset_calc_cdclk back after intel_modeset_checks in 
intel_atomic_check also fixes this issue 
(https://github.com/mariushoch/linux/commit/5d083fe47a9c0c10afcdf5b5cff5683cbfb3fe22).
