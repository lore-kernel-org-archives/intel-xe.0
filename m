Subject: drm: Add drm_work_fence helper

GPU drivers often need to queue work when a dma-fence signals
because certain operations (copy_to_user, eventfd_signal, memory
allocation) cannot run in IRQ context. This helper handles the
dma-fence-callback-to-workqueue pattern.

[Severity: Critical]
Does this callback execution leave a race window?

The callback in drm_work_fence_cb() executes asynchronously. Between its
execution and the call to queue_work(), there appears to be no state indica=
ting
to cancel_work_sync() that the work is active.

[Severity: Critical]
Does this -ENOENT fast path also contain the same race window?

If drm_work_fence_cancel_sync() is called by a teardown thread just before
drm_work_fence_queue() is executed here, it seems cancel_work_sync() could
fail to wait for the work to finish.

> +{
> +	if (drm_work_fence_cancel(wfence))
> +		return;
> +	if (cancel_work_sync(&wfence->work))
> +		drm_work_fence_put(wfence);
> +}

[Severity: Critical]
Could this logic lead to a use-after-free regression during teardown?

This function seems to assume that if the callback is not in the list, eith=
er
the work is already pending/running, or the work has finished. It appears to
ignore the window where the work is about to be queued but is not yet pendi=
ng.

Can this sequence occur when an unprivileged userspace application concurre=
ntly
signals a fence and destroys the context?

CPU1 (signaling thread or -ENOENT path)
Removes callback from the list, then executes drm_work_fence_cb() but is
preempted before calling queue_work().

CPU2 (teardown thread) sees this in drm_work_fence_cancel_sync():
    if (drm_work_fence_cancel(wfence))
        // Returns false because callback is not in the list

    if (cancel_work_sync(&wfence->work))
        // Returns false immediately because work hasn't been queued yet

Function returns, allowing the driver to tear down resources.

CPU1 resumes:
Calls queue_work(), and the worker executes, accessing the freed driver
resources.
