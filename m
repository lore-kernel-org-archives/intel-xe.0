commit a5f154fe3d2dddb5c9740e818e4993aaff0079d8
Author: Mario Limonciello <mario.limonciello@amd.com>
Subject: drm: add connector backlight (LUMINANCE) infrastructure

This commit adds a generic per-connector LUMINANCE property to allow driving
backlight brightness through the DRM atomic modeset path. It embeds a
drm_backlight structure in every connector and links it to backend devices
like the backlight subsystem via workqueues.

[Severity: Medium]
Does this sequence violate DPMS semantics and cause visual artifacts?

drm_backlight_set_luminance() schedules the backlight to turn off asynchron=
ously
via a workqueue, but drm_atomic_bridge_chain_disable() immediately disables
the display pipeline synchronously. The pipeline might turn off before the
backlight is actually off.

[Severity: High]
Can this cause data races by dereferencing the live connector state?

Because this runs asynchronously in the non-blocking commit tail, the live
connector->state might have already been swapped by a subsequent atomic com=
mit.
Should this use the captured new_conn_state instead?

[Severity: High]
Does this unintentionally override the legacy DPMS state on subsequent comm=
its?

By relying solely on the CRTC's active state, if a single connector is set =
to
DPMS OFF (but the CRTC remains active for other cloned connectors), the next
atomic commit will incorrectly restore this connector's backlight.

[Severity: High]
Does this erroneously dim all connectors on the CRTC instead of just the
target connector?

When userspace sets one connector to DPMS OFF on a cloned output setup, this
will unintentionally turn off the backlight for all other active connectors
attached to the same CRTC.

[Severity: Medium]
Can this trigger a sleeping in atomic context warning?

__drm_backlight_set() is called with the drm_backlight_lock spinlock held.
However, it invokes the get_range callback, which the API contract states
is allowed to sleep and must not be called from atomic contexts.

[Severity: High]
Is it safe to mutate the active DRM atomic connector state directly?

The connector->state represents the committed, immutable atomic state. Modi=
fying
it outside of an atomic commit transaction could cause data races and torn =
state
when concurrent readers (like state duplication) access it.

[Severity: High]
Can this early return lead to a use-after-free during connector teardown?

If one thread drops the lock to call cancel_work_sync(), a concurrent thread
(e.g., connector teardown) calling drm_backlight_do_unlink() will see
!b->funcs and return immediately. This second thread will proceed to free t=
he
connector while the first thread is still executing cancel_work_sync(&b->wo=
rk)
inside the freed memory block.

[Severity: Medium]
Does this missing cleanup leave a dangling sysfs symlink?

When unlinking the backend, the backlight sysfs symlink created in
drm_sysfs_connector_add_late() is not removed, which will leave a stale
symlink pointing to a freed device object.

[Severity: High]
Can this cause a race condition resulting in a NULL pointer dereference?

After dropping the lock for cancel_work_sync(), a concurrent
drm_backlight_link() could have linked a new backend. Unconditionally execu=
ting
b->backend =3D NULL here will overwrite the newly linked backend, causing t=
he next
hardware update to dereference NULL.

> +
> +	backlight_device_unref(bd);

[Severity: Low]
Does this hardcoded unref violate the backend-agnostic design?

Resource cleanup is explicitly hardcoded to the backlight_device subsystem,
preventing the addition of other backends without modifying the core.

[ ... ]
> +void drm_backlight_connector_cleanup(struct drm_connector *connector)
> +{
> +	struct drm_backlight *b =3D &connector->backlight;
> +
> +	WARN_ON(__drm_backlight_is_linked(b));

[Severity: Medium]
Will this trigger an unconditional lockdep assertion failure?

__drm_backlight_is_linked() unconditionally asserts that drm_backlight_lock
is held, but it is being called here without acquiring the lock.

[Severity: High]
Does this error path leak memory and cause a use-after-free?

If a connector fails probe before being registered, drm_connector_cleanup()
is called, bypassing the unregister path. This function only warns but fails
to remove the backlight from drm_backlight_list or cancel its work item,
leaving a dangling pointer when the connector is freed.

> +{
> +	guard(spinlock)(&drm_backlight_lock);

> +}

[Severity: High]
Can this lead to a use-after-free?

This returns a raw pointer to a reference-counted object without incrementi=
ng
the refcount. If the backlight is unregistered concurrently, callers
(like drm_sysfs_connector_add_late) will dereference a freed pointer.

[Severity: High]
Is the found pointer safe to dereference outside of the spinlock?

The spinlock is dropped before calling drm_backlight_do_unlink(found).
Concurrently, the connector embedding this backlight could be unregistered
and freed, leading to a use-after-free when found is dereferenced.

[Severity: High]
Can this cause a use-after-free when creating the sysfs link?

drm_backlight_get_device() does not take a reference on bd. If the backlight
device is concurrently unregistered and freed, dereferencing bd->dev.kobj
here will trigger a UAF.
