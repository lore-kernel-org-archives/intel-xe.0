I disagree here. At unbind time we decouple the HW and SW state, The
device no longer uses it's pointers to the page-table so, for example
VRAM page-tables can be torn down, system page-tables lose their dma-
mappings, but in xe we don't tear down the page-table structure itself.

If HW accesses are properly protected by drm_dev_enter() /
drm_dev_exit(), Hw won't be accessed after unbind.

I view the VM as software state, page-table pointers, dma-mappings and
VRAM storage as HW state.

It seems like what we're not agreeing on is where to separate those. I
see no reason as to why we would complicate the driver to remove more
than necessary at unbind time?

We don't (Unless we have bugs, and you may have stumbled on those
below?) Those should be removed at unbind time. We should also revoke
dma-buf mappings and SVM migrates all dma-buf mappings to system.

The current model used by xe (and amdgpu AFACT, that also ties vm
lifetime to file lifetime) is to block all hardware access and dma at
unbind time. The rest is state that doesn't necessarily need to be torn
down at unbind time. I believe the current separation is mostly done
with drm_dev_enter() / drm_dev_exit() and why should we enforce a
change of that? I'd say the drivers should be free to release what's
convenient.

Also if drm_gpuvms are designed to not outlive the struct device, why
do they need to take a struct drm_device reference in the first place,
I mean I brought this problem up then and IIRC I think you argued the
reference was needed and punted any problems it caused to the drivers?

Agreed, Unless there is something protecting the hardware access after
unplug in that control subsystem, that's a genuine bug, but that's
separate from this discussion

I don't think we are. As long as all HW access is given up or blocked,
we're fine.

Hardware isn't touched but I don't think there is any reason for
cleanup tasks to stop executing at unbind time?

Yes, this *can* probably be taken down at unbind time at the expense of
subsystem and structure validity checking, but it doesn't have to.

But that is arguably something that's never going to happen, and even
if it is, I think that's mostly orthogonal to code keeping references
to drm_device.

So then we can remove it's drm device reference? Why would it need to
keep a reference to the software state guaranteed to outlive it?

Regardless, I can remove all mentions of GPUVM in the documentation,
but that doesn't remove the fact that keeping a reference to a struct
drm_device without a module reference or a module presence guarantee is
extremely fragile, and will be also in a model that removes a larger
part of its software state at unbind time. IMO removing that fragility
is a good thing.

Thanks,
