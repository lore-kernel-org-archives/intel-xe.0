Hi, David & Christian,

Thanks for the feedback. I'll respin this to see if I can come up with
something that is more acceptable given the comments.

A couple of questions and comments below.

For the code at hand, if we insert an order 10 folio shmem will split
it at writeout time but spit out a warning (if enabled) at the same
time. For this particular use-case, I think it might make sense for the
drivers that use direct insertion to cap the page-allocator orders to
THP size (2M).

OK, yes it sounds like a prereq for this is that the driver actually
allocates compound pages. It might be that the TTM comment about *not*
doing that is stale, but need to check.

Would it be acceptable to export a function from core mm to split an
isolated folio?

Still that would alleviate a) and b), right? At least as long as we
keep folio sizes within the swap cache limits?

Thanks,
Thomas
