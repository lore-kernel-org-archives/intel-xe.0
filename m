commit 4014f9d380d34194182229a03855db38075d5806
Author: Mario Limonciello <mario.limonciello@amd.com>
Subject: drm: add connector backlight (LUMINANCE) infrastructure

This commit introduces a per-connector LUMINANCE range property to control
backlight brightness through the DRM atomic modeset path. It embeds a
backlight state in each connector and synchronizes brightness changes
asynchronously via a workqueue.

[Severity: High]
Does this sequence break the display hardware shutdown requirements?

By queuing the backlight off operation asynchronously via
drm_backlight_set_luminance() and immediately disabling the bridge chain,
the pipeline might be shut down before the backlight actually turns off.
Could this lead to screen corruption or panel damage?

[Severity: High]
Can a concurrent CRTC modeset free the CRTC state while it is being accessed
here?

Since the CRTC lock might not be held during pure connector property
commits, reading conn_state->crtc->state->active could result in a
use-after-free if the CRTC state is swapped and freed simultaneously.

[Severity: High]
Could this lockless read of connector->state trigger a use-after-free?

This function iterates all connectors and reads their states while holding
only the connection_mutex. If another connector receives a concurrent
property update, its state could be swapped and freed while being read here.

[Severity: Medium]
Will this cause unintended dimming or flickering on cloned displays?

When one connector on a shared CRTC transitions to DPMS OFF, calling
drm_atomic_crtc_set_backlight() queues an OFF request for all connectors
driven by that CRTC, even if the other connectors are still supposed to
remain active.

[Severity: Medium]
Is it safe to turn on the backlight for a disconnected panel?

If a connector is turned on (DPMS ON) but has no active CRTC (crtc is NULL),
this branch restores the committed luminance. Illuminating a panel that isn=
't
receiving a video signal could violate hardware sequencing constraints and
stress the panel.

[Severity: High]
Does this rollback path properly revert the physical backlight changes?

The physical backlight state is mutated asynchronously before calling
drm_atomic_commit(state). If the commit fails (for example, due to=20
validation failure), the software DPMS state is rolled back at the out
label:

out:
	if (ret !=3D 0)
		connector->dpms =3D old_mode;

However, the physical backlight might remain turned off since the
asynchronous work was already dispatched and cannot be rolled back here.

[Severity: Medium]
Could this WARN_ON() be triggered by routine hardware communication failure=
s?

If the backend communicates over I2C or similar buses, transient timeouts=20
or disconnections might routinely return error codes. Using WARN_ON() could=
=20
allow local userspace to spam the kernel log or cause a system panic if=20
panic_on_warn is enabled.

[Severity: High]
Can this in-place modification of connector->state cause a write-after-free?

Since this function is called asynchronously from a sysfs handler holding=20
only drm_backlight_lock, a concurrent atomic commit could duplicate, commit=
,=20
and free the connector->state object, causing this write to corrupt memory.

[Severity: Critical]
Does this early return leak a pending or running worker?

If b->funcs is NULL, the function returns immediately without calling
cancel_work_sync(&b->work). This could leave the worker operating on
memory that might be subsequently freed.

[Severity: Low]
Will the LUMINANCE property bounds remain stale if a new backend is linked?

If a backend is unlinked and a new one is linked with a different=20
max_brightness range, the property is not recreated because=20
connector->luminance_property already exists. This might artificially=20
clamp the new backend to the old backend's maximum brightness.

[Severity: Medium]
Is there a race condition here that could double-count luminance_clients?

If a new connector is linked concurrently with drm_backlight_inhibit_legacy=
_all(),
it might inherit the already-incremented global dev->mode_config.luminance_=
clients
count here.

[Severity: Medium]
Since the lock is dropped between incrementing the global luminance_clients
count and iterating the connectors, the iterator could hit the newly linked
connector and increment its count a second time. This double-count would
prevent the legacy sysfs interface from ever being uninhibited.

[Severity: Low]
Is this fallback brightness assignment guaranteed to fail?

Because backlight_set_brightness() strictly bounds-checks the requested
value against bd->props.max_brightness (which is typically around 255),
passing U16_MAX (65535) will mathematically guarantee an -EINVAL failure,
making this error recovery path ineffective.

[Severity: Critical]
Is there a risk of the connector being freed concurrently here?

The notifier iterates the list under the lock, finds a match, drops the=20
lock, and then calls drm_backlight_do_unlink(found). Without holding a=20
reference to the connector, a concurrent teardown (like a hardware hotplug)
could free the connector memory, resulting in a use-after-free when=20
drm_backlight_do_unlink accesses found->funcs.

[Severity: Low]
Does unregistering the backlight here break the sysfs teardown symmetry?

Because this clears the backend link before drm_sysfs_connector_remove_earl=
y()
is called, the latter will fail to fetch the backlight device and miss
calling sysfs_remove_link(&connector->kdev->kobj, "backlight").
