Thanks for this work, I will go through the series soon. (Although it would=

I'm not overly happy with this version history. I understand that you are
building things on top of each other, but going back and forth with adding =
and
removing features from a series is confusing and makes it hard to keep trac=
k of
things.

(In the worst case it may even result in reviewers skipping over it leaving=
 you
with no progress eventually.)

I.e. you stared with a CList and DRM buddy RFC, then DRM buddy disappeared =
for a
few versions and came back eventually. Then, in the next version, the PRAMI=
N
stuff came back in, which also had a predecessor series already and now you
added lots of MM stuff on top of it.

The whole version history is about what features and patches were added and
removed to/from the series, rather than about what actually changed design =
wise
and code wise between the iterations (which is the important part for revie=
wers
and maintainers).

I also think it is confusing that a lot of the patches in this series have =
never
been posted before, yet they are labeled as v6 of this RFC.

Hence, please separate the features from each other in separate patch serie=
s,
with their own proper version history and changelog. In order to account fo=
r the
dependencies, you can just mention them in the cover letter and add a link =
to
the other related patch series, which should be sufficient for people inter=
ested
in the full picture.

I think the most clean approach would probably be a split with CList, DRM b=
uddy
and Nova MM stuff.

And just to clarify, in the end I do not care too much about whether it's a=
ll in
a single series or split up, but going back and forth with combining things=
 that
once have been separate and have a separate history doesn't work out well.
