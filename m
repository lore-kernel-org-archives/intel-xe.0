Enable Adaptive Sync SDP for Panel replay + auxless ALPM.
First few patches are fixes in existing AS SDP enablement.
Later patches add the support to send AS SDP for Panel replay with Link
ON and with auxless ALPM (Link-Off). 

This series is in continuation from discussions in [1] [2] and more
recent [3]:

Apart from few patches from [3] new changes include:
- Some clean up in drm/dp Macros
- Add new DPCD bit to get FAVT PAYLOAD FIELDS PARSING SUPPORT.
- Add AS SDP version and PR and VRR specific bits in drm_dp.h.
- Modify AS SDP compute config to accomodate PR with Link On and Link
  Off.
- Program Downspread Ctrl DPCD bits.
- Make way for T1 and T2 AS SDP transmission timing/position.

Rev2:
 - Drop the redundant version member for AS SDP, and use the member
   revision
 - Drop member to store AS SDP transmission time, use simple helper
   instead.
 - Use Burst mode to write Panel Replay config DPCDs.
 - Split AS SDP configuration in compute_config() and
   compute_config_late() phase.
 - Always enable AS SDP whenever supported by source + sink.

Rev3:
 - Use ASYNC_VIDEO_TIMING_NOT_SUPPORTED_IN_PR bit also to determine AS
   SDP v2 support.
 - Drop patch to make provision to send AS SDP v1.
 - Add patch to include all relevant AS SDP fields in comparison.
 - Other refactor improvements suggested by Ville.
