No, they won't be trivial -- in fact, in the case of the Jobqueue they may =
even
end up being more complicated than a native implementation.

We still want to build the object model around it that allows us to catch m=
ost
of the pitfalls at compile time rather than runtime.

For instance, there has been a proposal of having specific work and workque=
ue
types that ensure not to violate DMA fence rules, which the Jobqueue can ad=
opt.

We can also use Klint to ensure correctness for those types at compile time=
.

So, I can easily see this becoming more complicated when we have to go thro=
ugh
an FFI layer that makes us loose additional type information / guarantees.

Anyways, I don't want to argue about this. I don't know why the whole threa=
d
took this direction.

This is not about C vs. Rust, and I see the Rust component to be added
regardless of this effort.

The question for me is whether we want to have a second component besides t=
he
GPU scheduler on the C side or not.

If we can replace the existing scheduler entirely and rework all the driver=
s
that'd be great and you absolutely have my blessing.

But, I don't want to end up in a situation where this is landed, one or two
drivers are converted, and everything else is left behind in terms of
maintainance / maintainer commitment.

Again, I'm not talking about Rust vs. C. I'm talking about why a new Rust
component is much easier to justify maintainance wise than a new C componen=
t is.

That is, the existing infrastructure has problems we don't want to build on=
 top
of and the abstraction ends up being of a similar magnitude as a native
implementation.

A new C implementation alongside the existing one is a whole different ques=
tion.

This I am sure about, but what about the existing scheduler infrastructure?=
 Are
you going to keep this up as well?

Who keeps supporting it for all the drivers that can't switch (due to not h=

I thought the API can't be abused? :) How would you prevent drivers doing t=
his
in practice? They need to have the struct definition, and once they have it=
, you
can't do anything about them peeking internals, if not caught through revie=

I'm not sure this is the core criteria for evaluating whether something is
maintainable or not.

To be honest, this does not sound very community focused.

Your driver? What do you mean with "it has to move"?
