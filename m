This split is intentional in that without it, we'd need to first
allocate 1 << order pages from the kernel's *reserves* in order to
later free 2 << order pages, making the shrinker much more likely to
fail in true OOM situations. (I believe this was one of the reasons the
initial shrinker attempts from AMD didn't work as expected).


I believe the solution here is in the ttm_backup layer, We should
introduce a ttm_backup_backup_folio function and either insert the page
directly into the shmem object (zero-copy) or even directly into the
swap cache. Then we should completely restrict xe page allocations to
only allow THP and PAGE_SIZE (Possibly 64K pages, but they'd either
need a split or perhaps they are small enough to be backed-up using
one-go copy, similar to this patch, but in the backup layer). FWIW at
the time the shrinker was put together, AFAIU SHMEM split large pages
on swapping anyway, but since that appears to have changed, we need to
catch up.

Inserting directly into the swap-cache WIP is here, rebased on a recent
kernel (This is an old idea that has actually been out on RFC once).
This needs a core mm bugfix (also in the branch), but I'm not sure the
swap cache is the right place to do this, at least not if we don't
immediately schedule a write to disc, it looks like current users don't
want to keep pages in swap-cache for very long (related to that bug)
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/thomash/xe-vibe/-/commits/thp_swapping2

Inserting directly into shmem (A fairly recent idea that is mostly
untested)
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/thomash/xe-vibe/-/commits/insert_shmem?ref_t=
ype=3Dheads
Since SHMEM schedules writeout immediately when pages are moved to the
swap-cache, it's not as susceptible to the above bug, since swap-cache
entries are not typically held for folios for which we haven't
scheduled writeout.

We should try to solicit feedback from mm people on these two
approaches.
