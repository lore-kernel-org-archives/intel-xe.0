Results from a full day on GuC 70.72.1 under my normal workload:

  59 stall events / 20 fence timeouts in ~20.6h, worst
  request-to-ack=3D2346ms, severe episodes still ignoring 8-9
  consecutive H2G interrupts.

Statistically identical to 70.53.0 - the firmware version changes
nothing, which matches your decode (GuC handling everything in time).
I attached to the gitlab issue the full dmesg of the day plus a fresh
devcoredump taken on 70.72.1 (same debug-sized GuC log buffers), in
case you want to confirm the decode on the new firmware too.

That leaves the GT1 cache-line theory (Wa_22016122933) as the main
suspect. I have a kernel built with XE_BO_FLAG_NEEDS_UC added to both
CTB allocations as you suggested (blunt version: both directions, all
GTs - just to test causality) and I am booting it tonight, with the
firmware reverted to stock 70.53.0 so only one variable changes.
Results tomorrow.

If the stalls disappear, I would be happy to help turn this into a
proper Wa_22016122933 implementation for xe, mirroring what i915 does
(scoped to the media GT on the affected platforms) - with guidance
from Matt/Thomas on the preferred shape.

Thanks,
Tales
