+1 for wiring order into shrink_control, and possibly also the priority
as mentioned in an earlier email.

However for cgroups-aware shrinkers, The number of free memory in a
zone might not be an indication of fragmentation-triggered reclaim at
all, it could be the result of the cgroup hitting its memory limits.

So I think if we can solve this with a combination of GFP flags,
plumbed-through order and plumbed-through priority, that would be
ideal.
