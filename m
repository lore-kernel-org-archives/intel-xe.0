That's a nice optimization!

I only read this after I stumbled across this in the code below.  Leaving t=
his
as-is is still a data race per LKMM and I'd expect KCSAN to flag it.

In any case, please also add the corresponding WRITE_ONCE() as well as a co=
mment
that explains why in this specific case it is OK to read the value without =
the
dma-resv lock held and why ordering is not an issue.

> Two pass locking requires a DRM_GPUVM_RESV_PROTECTED drm_gpuvm.

This is unfortunate, I don't want to have any second class citizens.

That said, I think I can make nouveau switch to DRM_GPUVM_RESV_PROTECTED. W=
ith
this, only MSM is left, and it says

	* We mostly want to use DRM_GPUVM_RESV_PROTECTED, except that
	* makes drm_gpuvm_bo_evict() a no-op for extobjs (ie. we loose
	* tracking that an extobj is evicted) :facepalm:

which is probably similar to why nouveau didn't do it in the first place. I
could have a look after LPC so we can get rid of !DRM_GPUVM_RESV_PROTECTED
entirely, which I think would be great.

Please use Assisted-by: LLM instead.

I think this should say that this is about "preparing" objects and object
validation.

Maybe "GPUVM EXEC two-pass locking"?

Ick! Not a huge fan of this, but I guess it makes sense. AFAICS this can ra=
ce
with drm_gpuvm_bo_evict() though.

drm_WARN_ON_ONCE() seems to make more sense here.

Same here...

That's really a lot of !drm_gpuvm_resv_protected() checks needed. :(

The name is a bit confusing, as the scope of the function is limited to an
exec_pass, but not the VM in general.

Even though a bit verbose, I think drm_gpuvm_exec_pass_has_evicted() is bet=
ter.
I'd probably also use the drm_gpuvm_exec_pass prefiy consistently for the
functions newly introduced for the feature.

That's a bit nasty, but it works and I can't think of a cleaner solution.
