It probably would, but it would create a precedent I'm not really
familiar with. Hotplug events are kind of separate because it really is
a hardware event most of the time: you get an interrupt, and report it
to userspace. And it's largely outside of the properties space (except
maybe for things like edid).

If we start having the argument that a property changing must trigger a
uevent, then it means that we can expect *any* property to do so, and
"the compositor needs to be in control of it" can apply to many, like
color formats, positions, tiling, etc.

It would be a much saner design to put it behind DRM_MASTER, and
deprecate the sysfs interface entirely.
