This discussion has also been covered to the maximum in the past.

It'll hardly keep the driver simple if we are adding a more complex
multiplexer IOCTL for basically everything in order to save in CPU
context switch time.

If this becomes a measurable issue, it's better to look into something
io_uring style to allow N IOCTL to be executed in batch. There have been
prototypes and discussions around this dating years back. I don't think
anyone has yet presented the concrete measurement data that we're
actually CPU context switch bound in probing the system capabilities.

If we have such data, I'd rather we spend the time to fix it for
multiple IOCTLs at once in uring style rather than making every IOCTL
into unnecessarily complex multiplexer call.

This is specifically called out in the discussion in [1] as a no-no.

What the userspace thinks they are checking here based on name is if
the running kernel is new enough to have VM_GET_PROPERTY_FAULTS
property to query, and instead they get information if the running
SKU supports USM.

There's two problems with that, it will only indirectly indicate if
non-zero faults will be reported in the *current* state of the codebase.
There's no reason why USM/SVM capability of SKU would ultimately decide
if page-faults can happen. It's just how things happen to be today.

Second, there's the tendency for such uAPIs to become implicitly used
to infer different information about the SKU. So in the future, if
has_usm and faults get detangled in the codebase, we'd have to add
DRM_XE_QUERY_CONFIG_FLAG_HAS_VM_GET_PROPERTY_FAULTS_REALLY_THIS_TIME
to indicate the availability of faults. The old one would have to remain
in the current state to actually mean "DRM_XE_QUERY_CONFIG_FLAG_HAS_USM"
because changing it might break existing userspace.

I'd rather we would avoid running into same uAPI design problems that
we've struggled in the past.

That's just how the codebase is today, there's no inherent dependence
here when approached from GPU/EU debugging angle of things.

The proposed name is literally about HAS_VM_GET_PROPERTY_FAULTS, not
HAS_USM or HAS_FAULTS. So reasonable developer is bound to assume it's
really about the question of the availability of that property.

And for availability the QUERY IOCTL idiom already has a solution in it.

If that is the problem, I think we'd be better off by documenting how
IOCTL based feature detection works, as that has been the de-facto
method for DRM subsystem for years as explained in [1], too.
