There's two lifetimes we have to deal with in drivers: the lifetime of (bus=
 /
physical) device resources, which are managed by the driver and the softwar=
e
state that is represented through the class device to userspace (e.g. file
handles).

The former is bounded to the scope where the driver is bound to the device =
and
the latter is unbounded and indeed depends on userspace.

Either the subsystem or the driver has to decouple those lifetimes. I.e. if=
 the
driver is unbound it should clean up all GPUVMs as they represent the GPU's
virtual address space and hence are associated with the hardware. However, =
the
driver should not operated the hardware anymore after driver unbind.

So, in your case it seems that file lifetime and VM lifetime are conflated
although they should be separate.

We can't have userspace to decide when we drop device resources, such as DM=
A
mappings, I/O memory mappings, etc.

Right, I forgot about them for a second. However, they are similar to the
release() callbacks as in they are the wrong cleanup model for driver priva=
te
structures.

drmm is a great tool for common subsystem structures that lifetime wise tie=
 to
the drm_device. But it is the wrong lifetime model for stuff that is used t=
o
operate the device, as this should be torn down on device unbind.

I had a quick look at Xe and found this for instance:

	 drmm_add_action_or_reset(&xe->drm, control_fini_action, gt)

control_fini_action() stops a worker that writes device registeres, which m=
ust
not be done after driver unbind anymore.

Now, there's two options, either after driver unbind this work is never run=
ning
(which would be correct), but then this could have been
devm_add_action_or_reset(), or it does actually run after driver unbind, bu=
t
this would violate the driver model.

I know it is not true in practice, but we are doing the wrong thing. We are
conflating the unbounded userspace lifetime with the bounded lifetime from =
the
driver model.

I also know that we can't fix this easily, but I want to create some awaren=
ess,
especially when we introduce more band aid for the status quo, such that we=
 can
subsequently address the fundamental lifetime problems.

Well, but the workqueue itself has a bounded lifetime, which should either =
be
driver unbind or module unload (when shared between driver instances). The =
work
items themselves should ideally not extend beyond driver unbind, because th=
ere
shouldn't be anything to do for the driver after unbind, because all the
hardware should be torn down and not touched at this point anymore.

I had another brief look at Xe and found this:

	drmm_add_action_or_reset(&xe->drm, ggtt_fini_early, ggtt)

where ggtt_fini_early() destroys a workqueue. It also calls

	drm_mm_takedown(&ggtt->mm);

which IIUC is the range allocator for the global GTT. (The hardware is gone=
 on
driver unbind (i.e. no more GGTT is available for the driver), so there's
shouldn't be a need for this drm_mm to live longer than driver unbind).

This model ties the lifetime of all shorter lived resources that are bounde=
d to
the driver unload scope to the unbounded lifetime of the drm_device that is
controlled by userspace.

I.e. the model is backwards and hence also extends your driver structures a=
nd
callback entry points not only beyond driver unbind, but also potentially b=
eyond
module unload.

If it would be done the other way around, tear down everything on driver un=
load,
and then use default trampolines for userspace still trying to call into th=
e
driver (which is also what DMA fence does and other subsystem do), all thos=
e
issues go away.

GPUVM shouldn't be lifetime wise tied to a software state, it represents
hardware resoruces.
