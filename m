Hi Simon,

For some context, I started investigating this because my Maxsun Arc Pro 
B70 would latch the blower at very high speed after a long inference 
workload and leave it there even when the node was otherwise idle. I had 
previously dealt with a separate idle-power issue where continuous Intel 
Level Zero Sysman/XPUM monitoring kept the card at elevated power with a 
model resident; after removing that polling, the card could return to 
low idle power normally. The persistent blower latch was the remaining 
reproducible problem.

I did some more targeted testing based on your comments.

I restricted the workaround to CHANNEL_PKG only and disabled both hwmon 
pollers so no other sensor reads could interfere.

With a 500-1000 us settling interval, the package-only workaround was 
not reliable. The physical blower could remain latched at high speed for 
several minutes after the workload ended.

I then repeated the test with a package-only 3000-3500 us settling 
interval. With monitoring disabled, the blower remained latched high for 
more than five minutes after inference stopped. A single temp2_input 
package-temperature read then immediately caused the blower to drop; the 
read returned 36 C.

So the workaround does not need to cover VRAM or individual VRAM-channel 
reads. A package-only force-wake appears sufficient, provided the 
settling interval is long enough.

I also confirmed that fan1_input is a separate issue: it can report 
implausibly low values while the physical blower is still running at 
high speed.

This makes the v1 patch broader than necessary. I'll narrow v2 to the 
package-temperature path and document the delay as an empirical 
workaround rather than an architectural timing requirement.

Thanks,
Constantinos
