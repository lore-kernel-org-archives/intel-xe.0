Well, ultimately also applies to userptr. How would we go about
implementing that without any outer locks?

Grab locks, figure out what pages are needed, release locks, pre-fault,
re-grab locks and do best attempt to resolve? And that's going to be a
live-lock at best again.

That'd be a massive undertaking for each driver, I think.

From my position, if userspace is injected to the dependency path for
resolving page-faults, with potentially unbounded execution times, the
timeouts would better be asserted at the FUSE/UFFD side and then simply
failing the operations with a bang if not met.

I was also meaning to convey that I don't think indefinitely blocking
copy_from_user() is acceptable, either. However earlier you seemed to
indicate towards that being something we should expect?
