Yes, if we establish that a DRM device must outlive a GPUVM (which by conve=
ntion
we implicitly do by storing a pointer) then you don't need a reference coun=
t.

However, there's nothing that ensures the caller sticks to the convention. =
And
given that the DRM device is reference counted already, taking the referenc=
e
count is the correct thing to do.

(As a side note, in Rust you can actually model and enforce this lifetime
relationship at compile time without a reference count. You can even establ=
ish
more granular lifetime relationships. For instance, you could have:

	struct GpuVm<'a> {
		drm: &'a drm::Device<Registered>,
	}

and establish that a GPUVM can only ever live as long as the DRM device is
registered and therefore implicitly also establish that the GPUVM can't out=
live
driver unbind, as a DRM device can't be registered beyond driver unbind and
hence the lifetime 'a is guaranteed to end before driver unbind.

In C you can only establish this by convention, and at least take the refer=
ence
count.)

The module reference seems orthogonal though, GPUVM is not actively emittin=
g
calls into anything (unlike a workqueue for instance), it's a passive data
structure. So, there's no need for any defensive measure AFAICS.

Sure, both approaches are there to cover hotplugging. Almost all class devi=

implementations have to consider hotplugging as it is depends on the bus th=
e
physical device sits on whether hot(un)plug can happen.

I think the question is not "Can I access the DRM device?", the question is=
 "Is
the DRM device still registered?", or IOW, "Is the DRM device still backed =
by a
driver?".

There's a bounded lifetime when a driver is allowed to operated a device, w=
hich
is between probe and remove. This is (typically) the same scope as the clas=
s
device (e.g. DRM) is registered.

After the driver is unbound from it's (physical) bus device, there's no val=
ue
anymore in letting the driver operate the class device (which is exactly wh=
at
register() / unregister() describes) in the first place.

There's nothing hardware specific left at this point, so it is not a driver=
 job
anymore; the lifetime decoupling can be at subsystem / component level (e.g=
. DMA
fence).

For the fence waits specifically, this can (or should) never happen. Driver
fences must be signaled on driver unbind. The hardware is gone at this poin=
t,
there's nothing left that could signal them otherwise.

I think those components should do the lifetime decoupling work instead. On=
ce
the driver is unbound, none of the driver callbacks are "special" anymore a=
s
there's nothing hardware specific left at this point.
