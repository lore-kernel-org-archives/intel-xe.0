xe_exec_ioctl() locks the dma-resv of every BO mapped in the VM in one
drm_exec transaction, then validates, rebinds and submits. Any migration
or fault-in a client needs therefore happens while it holds the dma-resv
of every object it has mapped, including the ones shared with other
processes. A client faulting in a large buffer of its own stalls whoever
else has those shared objects mapped, so the compositor it is presenting
to can miss a deadline over a set of BOs it has nothing to do with.

Most of those objects are not ones the exec has to validate. Make the
exec transaction two pass, so that it locks the evicted BOs first,
validates them, and only then locks the resident ones. It ends up
holding exactly the locks it holds today, it just takes the ones it does
not have to validate last, once the expensive work is already done.

Only the external BOs are actually split between the passes. The VM's
dma-resv is held from the start, as before, so the evicted private BOs
are validated in the early pass too, without anything extra being
locked for them.

Nothing is unlocked in between the passes, so this needs no recheck and
no fallback. The late pass can still find something to validate, since a
BO it had not locked yet may have been evicted meanwhile; that is handled
the way it is today, with every lock held.

Two details are worth pointing out. xe_vm_rebind() rebinds the whole
rebind list in one go and attaches a fence to the dma-resv of every BO
on it, so it needs all of them locked; the early pass deliberately does
not hold the resident ones, so it leaves the rebind to the late pass
entirely. That is also the better order, since rebinding allocates page
tables and can therefore evict the very BOs the early pass is trying to
leave alone. And the sched job's fence slot is reserved in the late pass
only, that being the one which holds every lock the transaction is going
to hold, so it is still reserved exactly once per object.

A concern with splitting the passes is that validating in the early pass
could evict the very BOs the late pass is about to lock, moving the work
back under the full set of locks. Xe is immune to this by construction:
__xe_bo_validate() brackets its ttm_bo_validate() call with
xe_vm_set_validating(), and xe_bo_eviction_valuable() walks the
drm_gpuvm_bos of any eviction candidate and refuses the ones bound to a VM
the current task is validating. The early pass therefore cannot evict a BO
mapped in the VM it is validating, whether or not the late pass was going
to lock it. That guard predates this patch; self-eviction is pointless
work in a single pass too.

While at it, xe_gpuvm_validate() is changed to clear the evicted state
with drm_gpuvm_bo_evict() rather than by assigning drm_gpuvm_bo::evicted
behind GPUVM's back, so that the bookkeeping GPUVM now does there is not
bypassed.
