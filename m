I think we all agree on this and I also think we all agree that this should=
 have
been a separate component in the first place -- and just to be clear, I am
saying this in retrospective.

In fact, this is also the reason why I proposed building the Rust component
differently, i.e. start with a Joqueue (or drm_dep as called in this patch)=
 and
expand as needed with a loosely coupled "orchestrator" for drivers with str=
ictly
limited software/hardware queues later.

The reason I proposed a new component for Rust, is basically what you also =
wrote
in your cover letter, plus the fact that it prevents us having to build a R=
ust
abstraction layer to the DRM GPU scheduler.

The latter I identified as pretty questionable as building another abstract=
ion
layer on top of some infrastructure is really something that you only want =
to do
when it is mature enough in terms of lifetime and ownership model.

I'm not saying it wouldn't be possible, but as mentioned in other threads, =
I
don't think it is a good idea building new features on top of something tha=
t has
known problems, even less when they are barely resolvable due to other exis=
ting
dependencies, such as some drivers relying on implementation details
historically, etc.

My point is, the justification for a new Jobqueue component in Rust I consi=
der
given by the fact that it allows us to avoid building another abstraction l=
ayer
on top of DRM sched. Additionally, DRM moves to Rust and gathering experien=
ce
with building native Rust components seems like a good synergy in this cont=
ext.

Having that said, the obvious question for me for this series is how drm_de=
p
fits into the bigger picture.

I.e. what is the maintainance strategy?

Do we want to support three components allowing users to do the same thing?=
 What
happens to DRM sched for 1:1 entity / scheduler relationships?

Is it worth? Do we have enough C users to justify the maintainance of yet
another component? (Again, DRM moves into the direction of Rust drivers, so=
 I
don't know how many new C drivers we will see.) I.e. having this component =
won't
get us rid of the majority of DRM sched users.

What are the expected improvements? Given the above, I'm not sure it will
actually decrease the maintainance burdon of DRM sched.
