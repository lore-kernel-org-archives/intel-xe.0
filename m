Based on further chatting on this with Sima, I was volunteered to pull
together the discussion here.

We seem to have Sashiko picking up on patterns about accessing userspace
memory with locks held and potential for copy_from_user() (or userptr) to
then take indefinitely long to resolve. And that spreads to deadlocks
everywhere situation very fast.

Based on reading of [1] and [2], it seems pretty much expected FUSE
drivers can trivially deadlock and ultimately in worst case the situation
can only be solved by manually aborting those connections by sysadmin.

It also seems (from the Sashiko comments) that by design, there's no
upper bound for how long an operation can take, so a bad FUSE driver
may stall for however long it sees fit to serve page-fault or in the
case of [3] it may decide to not actually populate the PTEs (or maybe
invalidate them immediately).

Should we really be refactoring the whole kernel for the sake of
knowingly allowing potentially malicious userspace driver to idefinitely
stall or incorrectly resolve page faults? That'll be quite a lot of
complexity added to all the other drivers.

Or should there be more protections on FUSE / uffd to ensure such
idefinitive stall can't happen? Or maybe this is just an academic
problem and we amend review-prompts not to bring it up?

Or maybe I missed some part of the FUSE docs and this isn't a real
problem?

Regards, Joonas

PS. There is a related patch in [3] which tries to address the problem,
but we'll quickly run into live-locks and other issues even if we
refactored things into: pre-fault, take locks, do _nofault() access, and
retry if that fails.
