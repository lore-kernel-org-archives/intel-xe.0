Couldn't we make a sysfs write trigger an atomic commit then? That way,
it would always go through the atomic commit path, no matter whether
you're on a "legacy" compositor or not.

It would also somewhat untangle the uapi from the backlight subsystem,
because it's only really relevant for panels. For all the other use
cases, you might want to control the brightness but you have no matching
backlight device.

Make backlight read the current property then.

The way I see it, you're trying to untangle multiple issues at once, and
I'm not sure it's the best strategy here. I'd start with the luminance
property itself that wouldn't involve the backlight framework itself
(DDC/CI or MIPI-DCS sound like obvious candidates here), and once it's
in, I would figure out the relationship between backlight and that property.
