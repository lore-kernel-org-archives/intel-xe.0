Hi Imre,

thanks for the review, that is a fair point.
I agree that the fallback logic is the better place for this and I am
dropping the series.

I read the cover letter of [1].
If I understand the plan correctly, the follow-up switch to a
bandwidth ordered configuration selection would already avoid the
greeter case described here.
A 1080p60 mode would then pick a 5.4 Gbps configuration such as
2x270000 instead of the 6.48 Gbps 4x162000, and 2x270000 is what the
device trains today with the quirk applied.
The remaining modes that still compute to 4x162000 would fail
training once and then be handled by the per-configuration fallback.
That fully covers this device, so nothing is lost by dropping the
quirk.

Until then carrying the patch locally works fine for me.

One offer regarding testing.
This PCON fails channel equalization at 4x RBR deterministically on
every boot, so I have a reliable reproducer for the fallback paths on
PTL with the xe driver.
Feel free to ping me whenever the fallback rework or any other part
of the series could use a Tested-by on real failing hardware.
