Hi,

Yes, that is because the loop polling the pkg sensor for some reason 
stops while no client is connected, but it can be triggered once by some 
other events, such as changing forcewake state, or monitor hotplug.

So I have a background task running that just does

     while true
     do
         sleep 5 >forcewake_all
         sleep 5
     done

and I get working fan control, regardless of whether I'm also polling 
the sensors.

It works if the pulse is long enough to be noticed. If you send multiple 
pulses (because you are reading multiple sensors in turn) with only 
brief pauses in between, you're generating a longer pulse that has a 
higher chance of being noticed.

I'd bet it would also work to just assert forcewake for 10 ms instead of 
ten shorter intervals, so we can use a timer here to asynchronously 
reset instead of synchronously waiting in the hwmon readout -- we're not 
getting fresh values here anyway, because the loop has not woken up yet.

The real solution, of course, would be a firmware fix.
