drm/i915/cdclk: Don't trust boot readout for per-pipe cdclk/voltage tracking

This commit addresses a bug where cold boot corrupts the internal eDP panel
due to cdclk/voltage tracking assuming firmware-programmed state as its own.
It invalidates the tracking state during readout and forces the cdclk and
voltage update functions to skip early returns.

[Severity: Medium]
Moving this early return causes the state duplication and memory allocations
in intel_atomic_get_cdclk_state() to occur unconditionally on every commit,
including every page flip. Does this introduce a performance regression or
latency spike in this hot path?

[Severity: Low]
Additionally, since the old_min_cdclk value passed into the function is now
overwritten right after intel_atomic_get_cdclk_state() returns:

    old_min_cdclk =3D cdclk_state->min_cdclk[crtc->pipe];

Does this make the old_min_cdclk parameter passed by the caller dead code
that is never actually read?

[Severity: Low]
Similarly to old_min_cdclk, is the old_min_voltage_level parameter now igno=
red
and overwritten before it is ever used?

[Severity: High]
Does zeroing min_cdclk for all pipes corrupt the state for inherited pipes
that are not included in the first atomic commit?

If the OS performs a partial commit (e.g., a cursor update on a single pipe)
on a multi-display setup, intel_cdclk_update_crtc_min_cdclk() will only
update the tracking for the pipe in the commit.

Because intel_compute_min_cdclk() takes the maximum of all pipes' requireme=
nts,
will the untouched active pipes with 0 tracked requirement be starved of th=
eir
necessary clock speed, leading to a FIFO underrun?

[Severity: High]
Can this boot-time invalidation be silently undone during hardware sanitiza=
tion?

If a CRTC requires sanitization during boot, intel_crtc_disable_noatomic()
calls intel_cdclk_crtc_disable_noatomic(), which in turn calls
intel_cdclk_update_hw_state().

intel_cdclk_update_hw_state() loops over all pipes and does:

    cdclk_state->min_cdclk[pipe] =3D crtc_state->min_cdclk;

Since crtc_state->min_cdclk still contains the readout value, does this
re-seed the tracking values for the remaining active pipes, circumventing
the fix entirely?
